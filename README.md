# Fluorescent

A less frustrating app switcher for macOS.

![Fluorescent in action](screenshot.avif)

Have you ever pressed command + tab only to switch to the wrong app because your mouse cursor was in the way? Annoying, right?

## Features

* Works just like the native macOS app switcher except the mouse cursor won't hijack your selection, so you always switch to the app you intended.
* Simple, unobtrusive design.
* Nothing else. No preferences, telemetry, or automatic updates.
