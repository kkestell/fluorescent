# Fluorescent

A less frustrating app switcher for macOS.

![Fluorescent in action](screenshot.avif)

Ever hit Command-Tab and ended up in the wrong app just because your mouse pointer happened to be in the way? Annoying, right?

## Features

* Works just like the native macOS app switcher except the mouse won't hijack your selection.
* No preferences, network access, data collection / telemetry, or automatic updates.
* Simple, unobtrusive design.

## Use

On first launch, you will be prompted for Input Monitoring and Accessibility permissions. Fluorescent will also register itself as a login item. You can exit the application by selecting "Quit Fluorescent" from the menu bar icon.
